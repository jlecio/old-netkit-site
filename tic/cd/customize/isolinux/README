We modified the splash.lss file so that we have a Matrix logo
in place of the Knoppix graphic.

The graphic is in a somewhat odd format, called LSS16. As the name
indicates, it is limited to 16 colors. To edit the graphic, first
convert it to a PPM:

    lss16toppm < splash.lss > splash.ppm

(Adding -map flag it output the color map to standard error).
Next, edit the file using The Gimp. Save the resulting file as an
indexed gif with no more than 14 colors (plus black and white, for a
total of 16). Then, convert the file to a pnm/ppm:

    giftopnm < splash.gif > splash.ppm

To actually convert the ppm to a n lss, use this command:

    ppmtolss16 < splash.ppm > splash.lss

Also:
pngtopnm < file.png | \
  ppmquant 16 | \
  ppmtolss16 "#ffffff=7" "#000000=15" > file.lss

or:
giftopnm < file.gif | \
  ppmquant 16 | \
  ppmtolss16 "#ffffff=7" "#000000=15" > file.lss
