In this experience the host br has network connectivity (tun module)
with the real host. Before start the Netkit script you must create a
tap device as normal user:

realHost$ ifname=`sudo tunctl -b -u knoppix`

and then set IP address (as root):

realHost$ sudo ifconfig $ifname 192.168.77.1

as described in:

# To build and prepare 2nd partition Compact Flash (5MiB)
# (statistics go into non volatile memory into CF separate partition)
export CF=CFX
dd if=/dev/zero of=$CF bs=1M count=5
mkfs.ext2 -F $CF
tune2fs -i 0 $CF
mkdir /tmp/ntop
mount -o loop $CF /tmp/ntop
tar zxf ntop-db.tzg -C /tmp/ntop
umount /tmp/ntop
