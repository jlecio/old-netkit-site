In this experience the node "proxy" has network connectivity with the
real host. Before start the Netkit script you must create a tap device
as normal user:

realHost$ ifname=`sudo tunctl -b -u knoppix`

and then set IP address:

realHost$ sudo ifconfig $ifname 192.168.77.1

as described in:

http://www.tic.fdns.net/tic/html/lab-setting.html#network

Now you must add a routing rule:

realHost# echo "1" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward; \
          route add -net 10.10.10.64/28 gw 192.168.77.2
