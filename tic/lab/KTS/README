In this experience the vm-s node has network connectivity (tun module)
with the real host (Terminal Server). Before start the Netkit script
you must create a tap device as normal user:

TerminalServer$ ifname=`sudo tunctl -b -u knoppix`

and then set IP address:

TerminalServer$ sudo ifconfig $ifname 192.168.77.1

as described in:

http://www.tic.fdns.net/tic/html/lab-setting.html#network

Than you can add a routing rule:

TerminalServer# echo "1" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward; \
                route add -net 192.168.88.0/25 gw 192.168.0.250


Also the vm-s node has network connectivity with the real host
(Terminal Client).  Before start the Netkit script you must create a
tap device as normal user:

TerminalClient$ ifname=`sudo tunctl -b -u knoppix`

and then set IP address:

TerminalClient$ sudo ifconfig $ifname 192.168.88.1

Than you can add a routing rule:

TerminalClient# echo "1" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward; \
                route add -net 192.168.77.0/25 gw 192.168.0.1
