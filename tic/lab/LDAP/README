In this experience the replica server has network connectivity (tun module)
with the real host. Before start the Netkit script you must
create a tap device as normal user:

realHost$ i=`whoami` && ifname=`sudo tunctl -b -u $i` && unset i

and then set IP address:

realHost$ sudo ifconfig $ifname 192.168.77.1

as described in:

http://www.tic.fdns.net/tic/html/lab-setting.html#network

Than you can add a routing rule:

realHost# echo "1" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward; \
          route add -net 192.168.50.0/29 gw 192.168.77.2
