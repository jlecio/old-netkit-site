This experience is the *same* of the www.netkit.org with little changes
due to use of bind9 instead of bind. We added also a X geometry parameter
to position xterm in screen as in DNS hierarchy.


In this experience the root server has network connectivity (tun module)
with the real host. Before start the Netkit script you must
create a tap device as normal user:

realHost$ ifname=`sudo tunctl -b -u knoppix`

and then set IP address:

realHost$ sudo ifconfig $ifname 192.168.77.1

as described in:

http://www.tic.fdns.net/tic/html/lab-setting.html#network

Than you can add a routing rule:

realHost# echo "1" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward; \
          route add -net 192.168.0/24 gw 192.168.77.2
