In this experience the vHost has network connectivity
(tun module) with the real host. Before start the Netkit script
you must create a tap device as normal user:

realHost$ ifname=`sudo tunctl -b -u knoppix`

and then set IP address:

realHost$ sudo ifconfig $ifname 192.168.77.1

# echo "1" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward; \
             iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
