In this experience the pc-ext host has network connectivity (tun
module) with the real host. Before start the Netkit script you must
create a tap device as normal user:

realHost$ export ifname_rlab=`sudo tunctl -b -u knoppix`

and then set IP address:

realHost$ sudo ifconfig $ifname_rlab 192.168.79.1

as described in:

http://www.tic.fdns.net/tic/html/lab-setting.html#network

Than you can add a routing rule:

realHost# echo "1" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward; \
          route add -net 192.168.0.0/24 gw 192.168.79.2
