In this experience the AN2 router has network connectivity (tun module)
with the real host. Before start the Netkit script you must
create a tap device as normal user:

realHost$ sudo -u root tunctl -u knoppix

and then set IP address:

realHost$ sudo ifconfig $ifname 192.168.77.1

as described in:

https://www.tic.fdns.net/tic/html/lab.html#network

Than you can add a routing rule:

realHost# echo "1" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward; \
          route add -net 192.168.0.0/16 gw 192.168.77.2
