In this experience the "boot-server" node has network connectivity
(tun module) with the real host. Before start the Netkit script you
must create a tap device as normal user:

realHost$ ifname=`sudo tunctl -b -u knoppix`

and then set IP address:

realHost$ sudo ifconfig $ifname hw ether 00:00:00:00:00:01; \
          sudo ifconfig $ifname 192.168.77.1; \
          echo "1" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward

as described in:

http://www.tic.fdns.net/tic/html/lab-setting.html#network

In this experience is necessary to enable dhcp relay from real network
to virtual network:

realHost$ sudo dhcrelay3 192.168.77.2

To not depend from IP address assigned to the real network, we
assign a arbitrary class C address to eth0 alias interface:

realHost$ sudo ifconfig eth0:0 192.168.100.254
