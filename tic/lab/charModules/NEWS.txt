Then I have included in the joined tar a char driver that
connects 2 machines through char drivers, it is a very
instructive module, it uses kernel udp sockets to carry
data from one driver char of one machine to the char driver
of the second machine.
To try it, run the cloonix_net "double" demo, then upload
the chardev in both with scp, then open low.h file of the ONE,
comment the INADDR_SEND ... 0x7f000001, uncomment the
INADDR_SEND 0x02020202, then open the low.h file of the
TWO, comment INADDR_SEND ... 0x7f000001, uncomment
INADDR_SEND 0x02020201.
Then run ./cmd on both, it should compile your module and create
your /dev/chardev node and insert the module.

Then on machine TWO, do "cat /dev/chardev" and on
machine ONE do "echo tutu > /dev/chardev".

This should help you for your first char driver on UML.
