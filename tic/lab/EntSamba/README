In this experience the Samba server has network connectivity (tun
module) with the real host. Before start the Netkit script you must
create a tap device as normal user:

realHost$ ifname=`sudo tunctl -b -u knoppix`

and then set IP address:

realHost$ sudo ifconfig $ifname 192.168.77.1

as described in:

http://www.tic.fdns.net/tic/html/lab-setting.html#network

Than you can add a routing rules:

realHost# echo "1" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward; \
          route add -net 192.168.10.0/24 gw 192.168.77.2; \
          route add -net 192.168.20.0/24 gw 192.168.77.2; \
          route add -net 192.168.30.0/24 gw 192.168.77.2
