In this experience the host mngm has network connectivity (tun module)
with the real host. Before start the Netkit script you must create a
tap device as normal user:

realHost$ export ifname_ids=`sudo tunctl -b -u knoppix`

and then set IP address:

realHost$ sudo ifconfig $ifname_ids 192.168.78.1

as described in:

http://www.tic.fdns.net/tic/html/lab-setting.html#network

Than you can add a routing rule:

realHost# echo "1" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward; \
          route add -net 10.10.20.0/24 gw 192.168.78.2
